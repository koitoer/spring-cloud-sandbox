Cascading Failures:
  If one of the microservices are down, and it is a dependency of other one, we could affect multiple services.
  Single fail service can also be affected, disabling more services.
  In distribuited systems we have more opprontunity for failure

Circuit breaker pattern.
  Prevent cascade failures
  
Hystrix
  Part of netflix OSS
  Easy to use by spring-cloud
  detect failure conditions and open the circuit to disallow further calls, (20 failures in 5 seconds)
  Identify fallback mechanism, we could have a try-catch and fallbacks can be chained.
  Run one target service is unavailable
  Reclose itself after the application became stable again (5 seconds)
  Failure definition flexible (Exception thrown or timeout exceeded over time period)
  
Dependency spring-cloud-starter-hystrix
@EnableHystrix
@HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "defaultStores")
@HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod
                commandProperties ( @HystrixProperty ... circuitBreaker.errorThresholdPercentage -- % of request failed
                                                         circuiteBreaker.sleepWindowInMilliseconds -- wait before close the breaker
                                                         circuiteBreaker.requestVolumeThreshold --- # of request
                                                         execution.isolation.thread.timeoutMiliseconds -- expected time
                                                         circuitBreaker.forceClosed -- manually force the close 

Synchronously .. default
Asynchronously . Return a Future, just like @Async
  @HystrixCommand()
  public Future<Store> methodName(Map<String, Object> params)
  
Reactively ..... Suscribe, get a listener (Observable)
  @HystrixCommand()
  public Observable<Store> methodName(Map<String, Object> params)

Hystrix Dashboard.
  Monitor the circuit breakers and how they are behaving, with little web interface.
  Dependency spring-cloud-starter-hystrix-dashboard
  @EnableHystrixDashboard
  host:port/hystrix.stream
  
Monitoring using turbine.
  Single hystrix dashboard, that listen and aggregate the stream for other hystrix

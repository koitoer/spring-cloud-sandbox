API Gateway.
  Fallacies of distribuited computing.
  Accesing from public internet, will.  
    Expose out internal API
    Security 
    CORS Required
    Multiple Trips, multiple calls to generate a response
    Different clients have different needs, client have specific needs to assemble the content. We need to adapt the content for client.

API Gateway
  Single point of contact, you will have deployed there the custom API, one point to protect, 
  Consolidate the calls in just one
  Can have some caching mechanism.
  Facade to the real services, reduce the # of calls from the client, 
  Routes call to specific services
  Handled security
  Protocol translation
  Optimizes calls / Link expansion (HATEOAS)

  Routing and Filtering
  Can be used for many API Gateway needs.
  Routing - send request to real server (Reverse Proxy) - --  Add a mapped url and redirect to the service_port
  @EnableZuulProxy.
  1. Register with eureka and collects all the client-ids  /subject to call subject service.
     Calls are automatically load balancing
     Calls are circuit breakers as weell

======  Caching   =============

Client Cache - automatic if we use some headers, expire headers and 
Server Cache - 
    API Gateway
    Backend Service
    Method Caching
      Provide Caching Abstraction, we need to use @EnableCacheable
      @Cacheable annotation, describe the cache and key [ @Cacheable(value = "inventory", key="#sku") ]
      Use a cache manager - syncronizedMaps, Ehcache, Gemfire
      Drawback, cache policy should ideally be considered and expriring
  
  Etags
    Client ask resources and the header comes with the etag, generate a hash
    if-none-match, check the content and try to return the same, if it matches just send 304 if not 200 + content + etag
    Purpose is save bandwitdh, but there is no reduction for server work, only economy in network activity
    Shallow etags in server side
      @Bean
      public Filter shallowEtagHeaderFilter(){
        return new ShallowEtagHeaderFilter();
      }
    Client side
      CacheConfig cacheConfig = CacheConfig.custom().setMaxCacheEntries().setMaxObjectSize().build();
      CloaseableHttpClient cachingClient =  CachingHttpClients.custom().setCacheConfig(cacheConfig).build();
      RestTemplate template = new RestTemplate(new HttpComponenetsClientHttpRequestFactory(cachingClient));
      Feign does not support caching capabilities
